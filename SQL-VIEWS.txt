--SQL CREATE VIEW Statement
	---In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.
	---A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database.
	---You can add SQL statements and functions to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table.
	---A view is created with the CREATE VIEW statement.
	
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

	---SQL CREATE VIEW Examples
	---The following SQL creates a view that shows all customers from Brazil:
	
CREATE VIEW [Brazil Customers] AS
SELECT CustomerName, ContactName
FROM Customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

	---We can query the view above as follows:
	
SELECT * FROM [Brazil Customers];
